## Rick and morty human database Backend

### Getting started:

Rename .env.example to .env

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm  run  dev
# or
yarn  dev
# or
pnpm  dev
```

Or if you want to compile a whole server:

```bash
npm  run  start
# or
yarn  start
# or
pnpm  start
```

### That's it you can continue now with the frontend
